    <p>Anushka Sharma (pronounced [əˈnʊʃka ˈʃərma]; born 1 May 1988) is an Indian actress and producer who works in Hindi films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, she has received several awards, including a Filmfare Award. She has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 since 2012 and was featured by Forbes Asia in their 30 Under 30 list of 2018.</p>
    <p>Born in Ayodhya and raised in Bangalore, Sharma had her first modelling assignment for the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in 2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a model. She made her acting debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the highly successful romantic film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) and rose to prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films' romances Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012). For playing an aspiring filmmaker in the lattermost, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Sharma went on to earn praise for playing strong-willed women in the crime thriller NH10 (2015), and the dramas Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016), and Sui Dhaaga (2018). Her highest-grossing releases came with the sports drama Sultan (2016), and Rajkumar Hirani's religious satire PK (2014) and biopic Sanju (2018).</p>
    <p>Sharma is the co-founder of the production company Clean Slate Filmz, under which she has produced several films, including NH10. She is the ambassador for multiple brands and products, has designed her own line of clothing for women, named Nush, and supports various charities and causes, including gender equality and animal rights. Sharma is married to the cricketer Virat Kohli.</p>
    <p class="h4 BR-c">Early life and modelling career</p>
    <p>Anushka Sharma was born on 1 May 1988 in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.[1][2] Her father, Colonel Ajay Kumar Sharma, is an army officer, and her mother, Ashima Sharma, is a homemaker.[2][3] Her father is a native of Uttar Pradesh, while her mother is a Garhwali.[4][5] Her elder brother is film producer Karnesh Sharma, who earlier served in the Merchant Navy.[6] Sharma has stated that being a military brat played an important role in shaping her as a person and contributing to her life.[2] In an interview with The Times of India in 2012, she said, "I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even more than being an actor."[2]</p>
    <p>Sharma was raised in Bangalore.[2] She was educated at the Army School there, and received a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College.[7][8] She originally intended to pursue a career in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress.[7] After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career.[9] She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa.[10] In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection.[9] Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio.[10] Sharma later said, "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used to say, 'give us a blank look.' It was really difficult, not to smile".[9] Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles.[11][12]</p>
    <p class="h4 BR-c">Acting Career</p>
    <p class="h5">Film debut and breakthrough (2008–2013)</p>
    <p>Sharma made her acting debut in Aditya Chopra's romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), opposite Shah Rukh Khan. She took a day to prepare for her screen test at the Yash Raj Films studio and refused to do an impromptu one.[9] She was signed for a three-film deal with the company and landed the leading role of Tani Sahni, a young bride to a middle-aged man, portrayed by Khan. Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times found her to be "assured and upright" in the film,[13] but Nikhat Kazmi thought that she "lacks all chutzpah and can barely hold your attention".[14] The film was a major commercial success, emerging as the second-highest grossing Hindi film of that year,[15] and earned Sharma Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Female Debut.[16] Two years later, Sharma played the leading lady in the crime-comedy Badmaash Company, directed by Parmeet Sethi and co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film, which tells the story of four underachieving friends who begin a scam business enterprise, received mixed reviews.[17]</p>
    <p>Later in 2010, Sharma completed her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films by starring in Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy directed by Maneesh Sharma and co-starring debutant Ranveer Singh.[18] Her role was that of Shruti Kakkar, an ambitious middle-class Punjabi girl who starts her own wedding planning business. In preparation for the part, Sharma learned to speak in the Punjabi dialect, which she cited as the toughest part of her role; she described the way the lead characters in the film interact as "crude but cute" and it required her to "talk fast, sometimes mix words and even omit words completely".[19] Trade analysts expressed doubt on Band Baaja Baaraat's financial prospect, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star, and saying that by then Sharma was an "almost-forgotten" actress.[20] However, Band Baaja Baaraat earned positive reviews and emerged as a sleeper hit.[21] Sharma's performance was praised by critics, many of whom cited it as her best work to that point.[22] The critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Sharma "comes into her own as the ambitious Delhi girl, who dreams of upgrading to multi-crore Sainik Farms weddings".[23] For her work in the film, Sharma received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.[24]</p>
    <p>Sharma's first venture not to be produced by Yash Raj Films was the drama Patiala House (2011) directed by Nikkhil Advani and co-starring Akshay Kumar.[25] The film tells the story of a budding cricketer (played by Kumar) who encounters trouble in convincing his father of his profession; Sharma was cast as the love interest of Kumar's character. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised Sharma's work and labelled her a "metaphor for energy".[26] That same year, she re-united with co-star Ranveer Singh and director Maneesh Sharma for the comedy-drama Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. She featured as Ishika Desai, a salesgirl hired to outwit a conman (essayed by Singh), who ends up falling in love with him instead. The film and Sharma's performance received mixed reviews, with Piyali Dasgupta of NDTV calling her "believable but not endearing".[27] Despite mixed reviews, the film was a moderate success at the box office.[28][29]</p>
    <p>In 2012, Sharma played a supporting role alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif in Yash Chopra's "swan song", the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films and her second with Khan. She was cast as Akira Rai, a Discovery Channel reporter who harbours ambitions of being a documentary filmmaker. CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand wrote that Sharma "brings a spark to the film",[30] but Raja Sen disagreed and said that "while Anushka can indeed play spunky, she needed here to tone it down several notches".[31] For her role, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.[32] Jab Tak Hai Jaan proved to be the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2012.[33]</p>
